# Aerofighters
This is a game I created during the second semester of my B.Sc. program. This game was written in C++ utilizing the iGraphics header file. For programming, I utilized Visual Studio 2013, and for graphics, I used Photoshop CS6.

This is a game where you may play with other people. A maximum of two players can play at the same time. During games, just hit enter for the second player. Player 1 can use the keyboard, while Player 2 can use the mouse.
